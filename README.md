# Interview Tests
Repository for interviewing / programming tests.  

## Palindrome
Implement a function detecting whether a string is a palindrome or not.  
Example on valid input: `A Santa at Nasa`, `deleveled`, `Dumb mud`.  
Example on invalid input: `Hello world`.

## Duplicate license plate
In a list of license plate numbers (in this case in Swedish format, with three letters followed by three digits, like `ABC123`) detect whether the list contains any duplicates or not.  
The function should return *true* if the list contains duplicates and *false* if not.  
 > If interviewing senior developers, the problem can be tweaked to find an effective solution, which only looks at every license plate number **at most once**.
